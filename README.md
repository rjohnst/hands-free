Hands Free
===

A collection of extensions and plugins that aid with automating all the manual crap you have to do to set up Jenkins.

Here's a list of things it does:
* add-credential: adding global credentials (either username/password or ssh user with inline private key)
* add-git-install: adds a new git installation
* find-credential-id: find the id of a credential

Improvements:
* add-credential: output id of newly added credential

New Features:
* add view (optionally to a nested view)
* add/remove job from view
* set job filter on a view
* modify description of a view
* add a lock (locks-and-latches)
