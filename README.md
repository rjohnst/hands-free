Hands Free
===

A collection of extensions and plugins that aid with automating all the manual crap you have to do to set up Jenkins.

Here's a list of things it does:
* adding global credentials (for SCM authentication)

And the TODOs:
* list credential descriptions and IDs (possibly with a regex?)
* set path to the git executable
