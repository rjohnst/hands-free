Hands Free
===

A collection of extensions and plugins that aid with automating all the manual crap you have to do to set up Jenkins.

Here's a list of things it does:
* add-credential: adding global credentials (for SCM authentication)
* find-credential-id: find the id of a credential

And the TODOs:
* output id of newly added credential
* set path to the git executable
* add view (optionally to a subview)
* add/remove job from view
* set job filter on a view
* modify description of a view
